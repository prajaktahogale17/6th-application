This project demonstrates the implementation of Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source city to all other cities in a weighted road network.

In this program, each city is represented as a vertex, and the roads connecting cities are represented as edges with distances (weights). The user is prompted to select a source city, and the program calculates the minimum distance from that city to every other city using Dijkstra’s greedy approach.
